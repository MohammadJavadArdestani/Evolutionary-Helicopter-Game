# Evolutionary Helicopter Game
In this game, helicopters pass obstacles by pressing a key and scoring based on their distance traveled.
An evolutionary model can determine when to press the key to overcome all obstacles.
- ANNs are considered Entities in the evolution process that make decisions for key pressing.
- ANNs are fed by the horizontal and vertical distance of the first obstacle and the helicopter location.
- The roulette wheel is used for next-generation selection.
- The next-generation population is generated by the crossover method and Gaussian noise for mutation

You can run the game by this command:
```
python game.py --mode helicopter
```
